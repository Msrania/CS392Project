after that i will update GUI by adding:background and clear buttum and space area to show the classification result.
One of the problems in the first version was that there was no space to display the result. Of course, this defect will make the system useless. We fixed it
Also, the first version did not have a clear text button, which reduces the ease of use of the system. We put the button.
(v0.2.0)

pass/fail
I had difficulty with step #4 to install "fasttext" which took a lot of time to fix.
Also in dealing with "html" language, it is of course considered easy, but because I am dealing with it for the first time.
